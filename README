C ⊄ C++ — C is not a subset of C++

This repository contains a couple of slides, used in a workplace lightning
talk, to illustrate  some of the differences between C  and C++. This talk
was sparked by me stumbling across (even recent) blog posts that would ar-
gue the opposite (i.e. C ⊂ C++).

This is not an exhaustive list  of differences. And the differences really
do depend on  the different versions of language standards  you'd look at,
as well as the actual implementations (read: toolchains) in use.
